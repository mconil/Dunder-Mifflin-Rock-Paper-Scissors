## Approach

Started off doing my html setting up the title,classes and id's. After that i started off working on my styling with css. Once I finished doing some minot styling I moved into working on my Javacript  

## What did I get stuck on

I got stuck a couple of times with my code when it came to functionality. There are still some adjustments that my my project needs.
